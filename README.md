# Important Factors in Obtaining Grant Funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke

The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is a biomedical research agency that was created to, “to seek fundamental knowledge about the nature and behavior of living systems and the application of that knowledge to enhance health, lengthen life, and reduce illness and disability.” To carry out this mission, the NIH invests billions of dollars each year in biomedical research. About 80% of the NIH's budget is awarded through almost 50,000 competitive grants to more than 300,000 researchers at more than 2,500 research institutions in the United States and around the world. Close to 10% of the NIH’s budget is utilized for projects conducted within its own laboratories.

The NIH employs a peer review system in which a committee of scientists evaluates grant applications on criteria, such as approach, innovation, and significance. Subsequently, these grant application evaluations lead to grant funding awards. Previous literature reveals bias and disparities in this grant funding mechanism. An analysis of ethnicity and race in R01 grant funding from the NIH revealed that, “black applicants remain 10 percentage points less likely than whites to be awarded NIH research funding” (Ginther et al., 2011). Moreover, an evaluation of grant funding from the NIH for 25,674 investigators in 2015 showed that, “while the NIH gives half of all research project grant dollars to about 19% of funded investigators, half the money goes to just 2% of funded organizations and 10% of states” (Wahls W. P., 2018). There are many factors that can influence NIH grant funding, including gender and race, affiliation and professional networks, and grant funding and publication records. Ultimately, deducing the importance of these factors in researchers’ NIH grant funding success proves a challenging and interesting problem.

The objective of this project is to determine factors that play a significant role in neuroscience researchers’ grant funding from the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke (NINDS).
