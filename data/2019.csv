Once in the brain; the thought is that HIVremains in that compartment and does not contribute to dissemination of HIV to other organs. To the contrary;we show (using an animal model) that this is not the case and that HIV in the CNS can migrate out and infectother peripheral organs. This finding has implications to the contribution of the CNS as a reservoir (a specificcell type called astrocyte). Here we will expand on our studies to understand the question of how this happens;if it still happens under antiretroviral treatment and more so under some antiretroviral drugs; and how does thevirus evolve over time in this scenario.

This is a useful coping strategyin situations where there is impending danger. However; avoidance responses can also be maladaptive. Thisis typical of many anxiety disorders; such as phobias (e.g. avoiding air transportation) and social anxiety (e.g.avoiding social situations). In fact; avoidance is a hallmark of most forms of pathological anxiety; in which thetendency to avoid is so strong that it interferes with normal daily activities.

Astrocytes; however; the most numerous cell type in the brain; play a significant role in neurotransmission; chemical homeostasis; and synaptic plasticity. They also respond to high frequency stimulation similar to clinical DBS by altering important regulators of neuronal network activity and inducing release of glutamate; ATP; and adenosine.

Pathological changes inglobus pallidus correlate with Parkinson's and Huntington's disease. Recent studies have greatly enhanced our understanding of the cell types in globus pallidus and their projections. We propose to assess the subtypes of NMDA class of ionotropic glutamate receptors expressed on these distinct cell types and their influence on neuronal activity. We will also address the impact of modulation these receptors on motor dysfunction in a mouse model of Parkinson's disease.

A majorlimitation to discovery of new treatment approaches is the underlying complexity of brain pathology in PD withdementia subjects. Individual patients may have various combinations of abnormal protein depositions;including proteins called alpha-synuclein; beta-amyloid; and tau. These proteins are potentially hallmarks ofdiffering pathways and types of brain injury; and are unlikely all to respond to the same type of treatmentintervention. Thus; progress in the field of PD with dementia will require methods to identify involvedpathways and protein depositions in individual patients. In the present research proposal; we will applyrecently-developed research brain imaging methods that can reveal the major degenerating pathways andprotein accumulations in PD with dementia. We will evaluate whether this approach results in differing typesof symptoms or of symptom progression in individual patients; depending on their imaging results. Ultimately;we expect this brain imaging approach will permit the future design and testing of new specifically-targetedtreatments to slow or halt the development of dementia in PD patients.,NINDS,9514273,13-Dec-18,RFA-NS-16-022,5U01NS100611-03,5,U01,NS,100611,3,,"BABCOCK, DEBRA J",25-Sep-16,30-Nov-21,Special Emphasis Panel (ZNS1-SRB-T (20)),,1862775,"FREY, KIRK A.",Not Applicable,12,RADIATION-DIAGNOSTIC/ONCOLOGY,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,1506502,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES, ,1-Dec-18,30-Nov-19,853,Research Projects,2019,NIA,268441,142220,410661,

Our proposal; usingseveral innovative approaches; will focus on the drug-metabolizing enzyme cytochrome P450; we will study P450-baseddrug interactions at the human blood-brain barrier; which determine the final efficacy of a given drug in normal and drug-resistant epileptic brain. We will study a homogeneous patient population (with focal drug-resistant epilepsy due tocortical dysplasia) to test combination of CYP-regulated and/or non-CYP-regulated antiepileptic drugs. This multifacetedapproach allows us to elucidate the function and mechanisms of CYP metabolic transformation; at the human blood-brainbarrier; of such commonly co-prescribed antiepileptic drugs to their reactive or inactive metabolites; the CYP-drugdistribution in the epileptic brain; involvement with multiple drug transporters; and together their impact on neuronalintegrity.

One major approach to developing new MS treatments is the development of therapeutics that canact on myelin-producing oligodendrocytes to promote the production and/or stability of myelin. We have foundthat the cell surface receptor GPR37 is highly expressed in oligodendrocytes; protects against demyelinationand interacts with the myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG). We propose to study the interaction betweenGPR37 and MAG to understand the physiological significance of this interaction and shed light on the potentialof GPR37 as a therapeutic target for treating demyelination disorders such as MS.!!,NINDS,9644099,14-Jan-19,PA-16-161,5R21NS106323-02,5,R21,NS,106323,2,,"MORRIS, JILL A",15-Feb-18,31-Jan-20,Cellular and Molecular Biology of Glia Study Section (CMBG) ,,1885825,"HALL, RANDY A.",Not Applicable,5,PHARMACOLOGY,66469933,US,33.762977,-84.42296,2384501,EMORY UNIVERSITY,ATLANTA,GA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,30322-4250,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,150000,84000,234000,

Several studies indicate that alterations in genes that function in theEndo/Lysosomal System (ELS) result in elevated susceptibility for such mental disorders. A specificexample; is the ELS protein VAMP7; which has been detected in genetic screens in humans with aheritable form of BPAD; suggesting that the downregulation of VAMP7 could be relevant in BPADsusceptibility. Hence; elucidating the cellular pathophysiology of endosome and lysosome dysfunctionmay help in understanding BPAD development. We have generated a Drosophila model system whichimpairs VAMP7 expression. Our preliminary work indicates that VAMP7 deficiency alters synaptictransmission; short-term memory and lifespan. Given VAMP7 established role in endosome function;this application will define the defects in synaptic function present in a Drosophila model system withthe ELS dysfunction via VAMP7 deficiency. This project will contribute in dissecting the regulatorypathways of neuronal communication in the context of endo/lysosome function. The results willelucidate how the ELS regulates synaptic transmission and enhance our understanding of the cellularbasis for neuronal communication and its impairment in the mentioned mental disorders.,NINDS,9824030,15-Jan-19,PA-18-906,3R01NS108778-01S1,3,R01,NS,108778,1,S1,"MILLER, DANIEL L",1-Jan-19,31-Jul-21,,,11618207,"JORQUERA, RAMON A",Not Applicable,98,OTHER BASIC SCIENCES,90534694,US,18.202288,-66.577983,1204101,UNIVERSIDAD CENTRAL DEL CARIBE,BAYAMON,PR,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,00960-6032,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-19,31-Jul-19,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,21547,,21547,

Changes in the gut microbiome (the collectionof trillions of bacteria that colonize the gut) represent a potential environmental risk factor in MS. We proposeto use an animal model of MS to understand interactions between genetics and this environmental factor;employing a well-controlled powerful mouse genetics system. The gut microbiome represents a new frontier inhuman health and disease; as it could be used both diagnostically and therapeutically. However; cause andeffect are difficult to separate in human studies; and our mouse studies will provide a critical frame work for theinterpretation and application of the results from human studies.,NINDS,9619292,4-Jan-19,PA-16-160,5R01NS097596-03,5,R01,NS,97596,3,,"UTZ, URSULA",15-Mar-17,31-Jan-22,"Clinical, Integrative and Molecular Gastroenterology Study Section (CIMG) ",,10396955,"KREMENTSOV, DIMITRY N",Not Applicable,At-Large,INTERNAL MEDICINE/MEDICINE,66811191,US,44.478216,-73.200657,8738101,UNIVERSITY OF VERMONT & ST AGRIC COLLEGE,BURLINGTON,VT,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,05405-1704,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,218750,122500,341250,

We observed neurological disease phenotypes in mice expressing dominant-negative PPAR?; thereby identifying neurons as a cell type where PPAR? function is essential for homeostasis; validated a selective and potent PPAR? agonist; KD3010; as capable of rescuing htt neurotoxicity; and documented significant improvements in motor function; neurodegeneration; and survival in HD mice treated with KD3010 agonist. In this renewal proposal; we will determine how PPAR? promotes neuroprotection by examining the effects of PPAR? on bioenergetics function; autophagy; and mitochondrial quality control; by defining the cistrome and active regulome of PPAR? in normal neurons and HD neurons; by performing transcriptome analysis of HD mice treated with PPAR? agonist; and by validating identified PPAR? target genes and pathways in directed experiments in HD primary neurons cultured from BAC transgenic mice or derived from HD patient stem cells.,NINDS,9638595,7-Feb-19,PA-13-302,5R01NS065874-10,5,R01,NS,65874,10,,"MILLER, DANIEL L",1-Feb-10,31-Jan-21,Cellular and Molecular Biology of Neurodegeneration Study Section (CMND) ,,1926731,"LA SPADA, ALBERT R",Not Applicable,1,NEUROLOGY,44387793,US,36.006824,-78.924579,2221101,DUKE UNIVERSITY,DURHAM,NC,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,27705-4673,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,311220,151893,463113,

The typical method of creating computer models of coils within an aneurysm (called the porousmedium method) relies on assumptions of how blood flow interacts with the coils. To determine how accuratethis technique is; we will compare it to a reference standard of high-resolution scans of 3D-printed models ofcoiled cerebral aneurysms (containing actual aneurysm coils) created using synchrotron microtomography.Then; we will create an improved; novel method of approximating aneurysm coils using the homogenization ofmultiple scale expansions; and evaluate the new method?s accuracy; this method will improve our ability tomeasure clinically meaningful blood flow changes in patients with coiled aneurysms in the future.,NINDS,9619091,8-Jan-19,PA-16-160,5R01NS105692-02,5,R01,NS,105692,2,,"KOENIG, JAMES I",1-Jan-18,31-Dec-22,Neuroscience and Ophthalmic Imaging Technologies Study Section (NOIT) ,,14212235,"LEVITT, MICHAEL ROBERT",Not Applicable,7,NEUROSURGERY,605799469,US,47.660049,-122.31441,9087701,UNIVERSITY OF WASHINGTON,SEATTLE,WA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,98195-9472,UNITED STATES, ,1-Jan-19,31-Dec-19,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,218750,111846,330596,

To date; the neurobiological basis of radio- and chemotherapy-induced cognitive decline remains largely unknown. These behavioral; morphometric and electrophysiologic studies will provide baseline and mechanistic data for determining the cause of these cognitive decrements. Data will directly evaluate the idea that cytotoxic cancer treatments elicit cognitive impairment by causing long-term reductions in dendritic complexity; spine density and by compromising synaptic integrity.

The poor outcome is partially related to their predisposition in adverse vascular eventsrelated to increased risk in hypertension and blood coagulation. Some circulating factors amongthese women may also make them resistant to drugs used to dissolve clots. Often the severityof stroke is inversely correlated to the degree of compensation of blood through a complexnetwork of circulation system called the collateral circulation; which comes to rescue when thereis insufficient amount of blood supply in the brain; particularly in areas where people commonlyexperience a stroke. Clinical studies suggest that the status of collateral flow is negativelyaffected in patients with metabolic syndrome. Although young and healthy women are usuallyprotected by the female hormone estrogen against vascular problems; diabetic women arereportedly to have less estrogen; thus become more prone to increased clotting and mayrespond poorly to stroke therapy that aimed to dissolve blood clots. Our recent experimentalstudies suggest that the increased clotting tendency in the diabetic female mice is related tosmall particles secreted from cells into the blood stream. Using an animal model of stroke ingenetically altered mice with type II diabetes and metabolic syndrome; we propose to study theunderlying mechanisms of poor blood flow compensation after a stroke insult in these agedfemale mice with metabolic syndrome; especially those related to the small secreted particles.Our data will offer great insight from a vascular perspective and improve clinical practice forwomen with metabolic syndrome who are at risk for stroke.,NINDS,9625803,21-Jan-19,PA-16-160,5R01NS102886-02,5,R01,NS,102886,2,,"KOENIG, JAMES I",1-Feb-18,31-Jan-23,Acute Neural Injury and Epilepsy Study Section (ANIE) ,,6412359,"LIU, JIALING ",Not Applicable,12,Unavailable,613338789,US,37.781166,-122.505244,2464601,NORTHERN CALIFORNIA INSTITUTE/RES/EDU,SAN FRANCISCO,CA,Research Institutes,94121-1563,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,218750,110718,329468,

Most studies have focused on adaptive T-cell immune responses. Innate immune responses are thought to be needed primarily; to activate T-cell responses; rather than directly direct cytotoxicity of tumors. Recently we showed that NK cells inhibit GBM progression by exerting powerful anti-GBM cytotoxicity. In turn; to evade NK- killing GBMs produce potent inhibitors of NK cells. Having established a model in which NK cells inhibit GBM growth and invasion; we will evaluate the complex network of innate immune cells (i.e.; immature myeloid cells) and signaling pathways (i.e.; TLR7/MyD88; and STING) which are responsible for this powerful anti-GBM response. Our data support the hypothesis that a network of innate immune cells; are necessary for the powerful NK-mediated anti-GBM responses.,NINDS,9625670,21-Jan-19,PA-13-302,5R01NS096756-04,5,R01,NS,96756,4,,"FOUNTAIN, JANE W",15-Feb-16,31-Jan-21,Clinical Neuroimmunology and Brain Tumors Study Section (CNBT) ,,6806585,"LOWENSTEIN, PEDRO R",Not Applicable,12,NEUROSURGERY,73133571,US,42.244005,-83.73915,1506502,UNIVERSITY OF MICHIGAN AT ANN ARBOR,ANN ARBOR,MI,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,48109-1276,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,267533,147143,414676,

The irreversible death of brain tissue isa termed a cerebral infarct. This event is termed an ischemic stroke. Stroke is the fourth leading causeof death in the US; with almost 800;000 new cases occurring each year. At least 50 new drugs havebeen tested in over 150 clinical trials for stroke; but none has proven to reduce the size of the infarctonce a stroke has occurred. Thus; there is an urgent need to identify and develop new drug targets toprovide effective protection to damaged brain tissues in the treatment of stroke.

Here we willaddress the cellular; network; and neuromodulatory mechanisms underlying the determination of optimal statefor neural and behavioral performance.

We will use a variety of state-of-the-art techniques; including whole cellrecording; two-photon imaging; and optogenetics; to reveal the precise cellular; network; and neuromodulatorymechanisms underlying rapid state control in awake; behaving mice.

In the near future; microstimulation in the sensorimotor cortex may provide somatosensory and proprioceptive feedback for close- loop"" control of prosthetic limbs.  These and other clinical applications of intraparenchymal microstimulation will require neural interfaces that must function more- or- less continuously throughout the user's waking hours and for many years; without injury to the stimulated neurons and without significantly altering their electrical excitability.  This is the range of stimulus parameters that would be used in a cortical level visual prosthesis; to convey proprioceptive or tactile information from a limb prosthesis into the sensorimotor cortex; or in a cortical- level auditory prosthesis.  However; it has been shown that prolonged microstimulation in the cerebral cortex using what has been considered to be conservative values of charge density and charge per phase (4 nC/phase; 200 ?C/cm2) will induce a loss of neurons adjacent to the electrodes sites; and these stimulus parameters will induce a depression of neuronal excitability (an increase in the stimulus current will be needed to induce an action potentials ) after as little as 7 hours of continuous stimulation in the cerebral cortex.  For larger ""macroelectrodes""; the interactions of stimulus charge per phase (Q) and charge density)QD) as they relate to safe and effective neural stimulation have been well studied.  However; a comparable analysis for penetrating microelectrodes that operates at greater charge density; and in very close proximity to the neurons; has not been conducted.  The present study will be the first systematic investigation of the interactions between stimulus charge per phase and geometric charge density during prolonged microstimulation in the cerebral cortex.  These data are necessary to inform the design of chronically implanted microelectrodes for clinical applications employing prolonged neural microstimulation.  The study will employ silicon substrate microelectrodes and microwire arrays implanted chronically in the post-cruciate (sensorimotor) cortex of adult cats.  We expect to identify combinations of Q and QD that are able to excite pyramidal tract neurons of the cerebral cortex without producing depression of neuronal excitability or neuronal loss during 200 hours of stimulation (8 hrs/day for 25 days).  The range of Q to be evaluated (2 to 16 nC/phase) will span all or most of the range that is likely to be used in a clinical interface employing intracortical microstimulation.  The stimulus will be delivered for 8 hours per day; for a total of 200 hours; at a pulse rate of 50 pps.

This disease primarily occurs in a subset of immunocompromised individuals; such as AIDS. In recent years however; this disease resurfaced in a subpopulation of autoimmune disease patients; including Multiple Sclerosis; who are treated with immunomodulatory drugs. Agnoprotein is a small regulatory protein of JCV plays important regulatory roles in JCV life cycle. It forms stable dimeric/oligomeric structures through its Leu/Ile/Phe-rich domain; which plays an essential role in stability and function of the protein. NMR structure studies revealed that the dimerization domain of the protein (Le/Ile/Phe-rich region) forms an amphipathic a-helix. Recent studies suggest that agnoprotein is involved in regulation of the splicing and nucleo-cytoplasmic transport of the viral transcripts. The goal of this application is then to further investigate mechanisms underlying its regulatory roles in those processes.,NINDS,9626439,11-Jan-19,PA-13-302,5R01NS090949-05,5,R01,NS,90949,5,,"WONG, MAY",1-Apr-15,31-Jan-20,NeuroAIDS and other End-Organ Diseases Study Section (NAED) ,,6626069,"SAFAK, MAHMUT ",Not Applicable,1,NEUROSCIENCES,57123192,US,39.977716,-75.145848,8240301,TEMPLE UNIV OF THE COMMONWEALTH,PHILADELPHIA,PA,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,19122-6003,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,250000,133743,383743,

The cerebellum is a primary center of motor coordination andmany reports in recent years indicate its involvement in cognition. Clinical data suggest that anytreatment method targeting cognitive disorders should consider the cerebellar involvementalong with relevant cerebral structures. Transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) of thecerebellum has seen a surge of clinical studies in recent years reporting improvements in motorlearning; cognitive and emotional processes. However; there have been very few animal studiesto explain the mechanism by which the tDCS modulates the cerebellar activity. The primaryobjective of the current proposal is to investigate the neural mechanisms involved in cerebellartDCS during a cognitive task in behaving animals.

The ubiquitin E3A ligase gene(UBE3A) located within the 15q11.2-q13 region is parentally imprinted and expressed only fromthe maternal allele in most neurons. Three differentially spliced isoforms of UBE3A have beenidentified; however; it is not known which isoform plays the most critical role in Dup15q. SinceUBE3A is imprinted specifically in neurons; this project will test the hypothesis that elevatedUBE3A in neurons is the major contributor to Dup15q phenotypes.

We have recently identified the functional single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)rs6265 in the Bdnf gene for brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF); which results in dysfunctional BDNFrelease; as a risk allele impacting therapeutic responsiveness in PD patients.

These diseasessignificantly impact the quality of life of affected patients and caregivers; with high social costs and inthe most severe forms; lifespan can be shortened. Currently; no effective treatment is available. Thus;the study of the mechanisms controlling the synthesis of myelin is essential to identify new paths ofintervention.  We and other groups previously characterized an important growth factor that controls the formation of myelin in the nerves. We also recently showed that other proteins; which act as ?biologicalscissors?; control the activity of this growth factor. In addition we recently demonstrated that these?scissors? induce the expression of other molecules; called prostaglandins that promote myelinformation and maintenance in the nerves. By using a combination of cell culture techniques and invivo animal models; we will investigate how prostaglandins participate in myelin maintenance andaxonal preservation. These studies will further elucidate the mechanisms controlling myelination in the nerves and are relevant to develop new therapeutic strategies to promote remyelination in patients affected by peripheral neuropathies.,NINDS,9623372,30-Nov-18,PA-16-160,5R01NS099102-02,5,R01,NS,99102,2,,"MORRIS, JILL A",15-Jan-18,31-Dec-22,Cellular and Molecular Biology of Glia Study Section (CMBG) ,,14085810,"TAVEGGIA, CARLA ",Not Applicable,n/a,Unavailable,430216149,IT,,,10034449,SAN RAFFAELE HOSPITAL,MILANO,,Unavailable,20132,ITALY, ,1-Jan-19,31-Dec-19,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,245267,18631,263898,

Although mitochondrial dysfunction is one of the most prominent feature in ALS; whether andhow mitochondria contribute to ALS-related dysfunction of NMJ and muscles is still not clear. Mitochondria arehighly dynamic organelles that undergo continual fission/fusion events which are critical for the maintenance ofmitochondrial function. Previous studies from our and other groups have consistently showed mitochondrialfission/fusion dynamic abnormalities in ALS experimental models. Here; we propose to investigate whethermitochondrial dynamics are involved in the progression of mitochondrial dysfunction; NMJ decline and nerveand muscle dysfunction in ALS transgenic mice in vivo; and more importantly; test whether the manipulation ofmitochondrial dynamics could slow or reverse NMJ decline and muscle atrophies in ALS.,NINDS,9625180,24-Dec-18,PA-16-160,5R01NS097679-03,5,R01,NS,97679,3,,"GUBITZ, AMELIE",1-Feb-17,31-Jan-22,Neural Oxidative Metabolism and Death Study Section (NOMD) ,,10308361,"WANG, XINGLONG ",Not Applicable,11,PATHOLOGY,77758407,US,41.505076,-81.609998,218601,CASE WESTERN RESERVE UNIVERSITY,CLEVELAND,OH,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,44106-1712,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,259039,151538,410577,

Using an unbiasedscreen for actively translating mRNAs we compared mice subjected to different dietary states; we observed an8-fold enrichment in the ethanolamine phosphate (PEtN) phospholyase; Etnppl in murine hippocampalastrocytes from mice that were fasted overnight. Etnppl protein irreversibly degrades PEtN which is used inmetabolic pathways of multiple lipid classes; and Etnppl has among the most highly differentiated mRNAexpression patterns in individuals with mood disorders (72% decrease) and schizophrenia (2-fold increase).The understanding of the role of Etnppl in the CNS will aid in the understanding of diet-controlledtranscriptional programs in the brain and metabolic aspects of neurological disorders.!,NINDS,9588804,28-Nov-18,PA-16-308,5F31NS102151-02,5,F31,NS,102151,2,,"SUTHERLAND, MARGARET L",1-Dec-17,30-Nov-20,Special Emphasis Panel (ZRG1-F03B-E (20)L),,12385302,"WHITE, CORY JUSTIN",Not Applicable,7,OTHER BASIC SCIENCES,1910777,US,39.329164,-76.617855,4134401,JOHNS HOPKINS UNIVERSITY,BALTIMORE,MD,SCHOOLS OF MEDICINE,21205-1832,UNITED STATES, ,1-Dec-18,30-Nov-19,853,Training; Individual,2019,NINDS,45016,,45016,

We recently discovered that when TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus of the nerve cell; its ability to keep certain unwanted coding elements of genes; called cryptic exons; is compromised in brains of patients with ALS or FTD. This new discovery suggests that loss of this TDP-43 plays an important role in causing nerve cell loss in these patients.

We recently discovered that when TDP-43 is cleared from the nucleus of the nerve cell; its ability to keep certain unwanted coding elements of genes; called cryptic exons; is compromised in brains of patients with ALS or FTD. This new discovery suggests that loss of this TDP-43 plays an important role in causing nerve cell loss in these patients.

This highly complex brain region has been implicated in a range of behaviors; including cortical activation; attention; motivation and memory; but the functional details are not well understood. Patients with Alzheimer's disease and in related dementias have a significant decrease of acetylcholine in the cortex and show pathological changes in cholinergic BF neurons. Part of the difficulty in understanding the role of the BF; as well as the processing characteristics of these disorders lies in the anatomical complexity of the region. The overall goal of this application is to improveour knowledge of the functional organization of the BF. The results will lead to more realistic animal models for addressing function in behavioral studies. Concomitantly; it will facilitate the understanding of the aberrant processing in basalo-cortical networks and may help the development of new treatment strategies to ameliorate the cognitive symptoms in these disorders.,NINDS,9632862,15-Jan-19,PA-13-302,5R01NS023945-27,5,R01,NS,23945,27,,"CORRIVEAU, RODERICK A",1-Aug-86,31-Jan-20,Pathophysiological Basis of Mental Disorders and Addictions Study Section (PMDA) ,,6177544,"ZABORSZKY, LASZLO ",Not Applicable,10,OTHER BASIC SCIENCES,130029205,US,40.739016,-74.175364,1196204,RUTGERS THE STATE UNIV OF NJ NEWARK,NEWARK,NJ,SCHOOLS OF ARTS AND SCIENCES,07102-1808,UNITED STATES, ,1-Feb-19,31-Jan-20,853,Research Projects,2019,NINDS,269595,143794,413389,
